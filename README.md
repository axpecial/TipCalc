# Pre-work - *TipCalc*

**TipCalc** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Andy Duong**

Time spent: **30** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

// List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

- [X] Split the total amount among a party

## Notes

// Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

My first step in creating this application was following the provided tip calculator walkthrough step-by-step. Although it was simple to find the right buttons on Xcode, I stuggled to grasp the idea of some key concepts in iOS programming, such as the difference between a delegate and an IBAction and Constraints in Auto Layout. As a result, I found myself looking through many StackOverflow threads in search of an answer that made sense. After producing the basic tip calculator, I wanted to learn about how I could improve my application. I compiled a list of tutorials, but I was unsure which of them were good resources, so I started with the Apple Developer Guide's meal prep app tutorial. Again, the content was confusing, which discouraged me from continuing through the tutorial. I called up one of my close friends, who shared my passion for programming, and we came up with an idea for a Whack-a-mole spinoff. We both knew that we didn't have enough experience to create this application yet, so we've been meeting at least 2 times a week over the winter break to work on iOS programming tutorials together. Having a end goal in mind that we both suppert and working together has motivated us to persevere through the struggles of iOS programming.
